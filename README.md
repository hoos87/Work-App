# Work-App
Using what I've learnt I am experimenting to create a console app in C#
that will automatically generate a rota drawing users from a pool of users
for a cell culture lab that I manage at work. The app can also add and edit existing users who use the Cell Culture facility. 


Future work:
1) Allow this program to create a file to save the data to
2) Create a more interactive UI that isn't text based
